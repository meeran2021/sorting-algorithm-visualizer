# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview

Sorting Visualizer is a web application designed to showcase the inner workings of various sorting algorithms. It provides a visual representation of how algorithms like Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, and Heap sort operate. The application offers features to enhance the user's understanding of sorting algorithms, including colored representations, control over visualization parameters, and insights into time and space complexities.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**

## Features

### 1. Colored Representation
   The visualization includes colored indications for each step:
   - **Blue:** Default state
   - **Yellow:** Elements being compared
   - **Red:** Elements identified as incorrectly positioned and to be moved
   - **Green:** Elements in the correct position

### 2. Visualization Controls
   Users have control over the following visualization parameters:
   - **2.1) Speed of Visualization:** Choose from 5 speed levels to control the animation speed.
   - **2.2) Data Size:** Adjust the size of the data set to observe algorithm behavior with varying input sizes.
   - **2.3) Generate New Data:** Randomly generate a new set of data for visualization.

### 3. Complexity Information
   The application provides information about the time and space complexity of the currently visualized algorithm. This helps users understand the efficiency and resource requirements of each algorithm.

## Usage

1. Choose an algorithm from the list.
2. Adjust visualization controls as needed.
3. Start the visualization to see the algorithm in action.
4. Observe the colored representation and gain insights into the sorting process.
5. Analyze time and space complexity information for better understanding.
